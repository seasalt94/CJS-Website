### What am I doing here?

I've spent the last 1.5 or so years talking about making a website as a way to publish or show-off side-projects and small hobby things that I've been working on. The only trouble is I haven't really done anything of the sort. I graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering in December 2016, spent a couple months working in a [chemistry lab](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/chem.201706004) (which was awesome), but since then I feel like I've stagnated in terms of professional and personal interests. 

This website is supposed to be my motivation for self-improvement: my kick in the pants. 

What's the point of having an empty portfolio anyway?

### What are you doing here?

I hope one day you are an employer, an angel investor, or the head coach of the United States Men's Nation Team giving me my first call up, but most likely you're a friend of mine who I've mentioned this site to. If you're interested in my professional work please look to the [Projects Category](/categories/project) just as soon as I get it working.

_To do:_

- ~~Get the project category link working~~ It worked! I think the site just needed some time to flesh out all the linking

- Get projects


Anyway, I guess we should both just [start here](/post/2018/11/05/455-days/)
