455 days ago today I started work at a fairly large medical software company in Madison, Wisconsin. About 3 weeks in I realized I didn't want to be there[^1] very long.

This is something I did in high school. It took me awhile to figure out - and it doesn't even work right yet - but hey it's mine. I wrote it; that's what this is supposed to be all about. 

Update 11/19/18: I went back and updated it so it works now. My main takeaway is that I'm bad at hangman. 
```python
# Simple Hangman game using an offical Scrabble dictionary (SOWPODS)
# Carter Salz 
# 11-19-2018

import random

# Read the master dictionary stored in the same local directory
with open("sowpods.txt", "r") as i:
    longList=list(i)

# Make it a little harder and create a new file with only 8+ character words
# Select a random word and strip the newline char
file=open("long_sowpods.txt","w")
for i in longList:
    if len(i) > 8:
        file.write(i)
file.close()
with open("long_sowpods.txt","r") as i:
    longerList=list(i)
myWord=random.choice(longerList).strip()

print("welcome to hangman")
blanks='-'*len(myWord)
print(blanks)
blanks=list(blanks)
myWord=list(myWord)
guess=input("Guess a letter: ")
guessed=[]
while True:
    if guess.upper() in guessed:
        print("You've already guessed that. Letter's guessed so far: "+str(guessed))
    elif guess.upper() in myWord:
        for i in range(0,len(myWord)):
            if guess.upper()==myWord[i]:
                blanks[i] = guess.upper()
        print("'"+guess.upper()+"'"+" is here!")
        print(''.join(blanks))
        guessed.append(guess.upper())
    else:
        if guess is not "":
            guessed.append(guess.upper())
            print("Nope! Now you've guessed: "+str(guessed))

    if "-" not in blanks:
        print ("You win?")
        break
    guess=input("Guess another letter: ")
```

Anyway its 1am now, maybe day 456 will be better.

[^1]: There? Here? Hard to say which is right but I'm still here as of "today".
