455 days ago today I started work at a fairly large medical software company in Madison, Wisconsin. About 3 weeks in I realized I didn't want to be there[^1] very long.

This is something I did in high school. It took me awhile to figure out - and it doesn't even work right yet - but hey it's mine. I wrote it; that's what this is supposed to be all about. 
```python
# Simple Hangman game using the offical Scrabble dictionary (SOWPODS)
# Carter Salz 
# 11-06-2018
import random

# Read the master dictionary stored in the same local directory
with open("sowpods.txt", "r") as i:
    longList=list(i)

# Make it a little harder and create a new file with only 8+ character words
# Select a random word and strip the newline char
file=open("long_sowpods.txt","w")
for i in longList:
    if len(i) > 8:
        file.write(i)
file.close()
with open("long_sowpods.txt","r") as i:
    longerList=list(i)
myWord=random.choice(longerList).strip()

print("welcome to hangman")

blanks='-'*len(myWord)
print(blanks)
blanks=list(blanks)
myWord=list(myWord)
guess=input("Guess a letter: ")
guessed=[]
while True:

    if guess.upper() in guessed:
        guess=""
        print("You've already guessed that. Letter's guessed so far: "+str(guessed))
    elif guess.upper() in myWord:
        index=myWord.index(guess.upper())
        blanks[index]=guess.upper()
        myWord[index]="-"
    else:
        print("".join(blanks))
        if guess is not "":
            guessed.append(guess.upper())
            print("Nope! Now you've guessed: "+str(guessed))
            guess=input("Guess another letter: ")

    if "-" not in blanks:
        print ("You win?")
        print(myWord)
        break
```

Anyway its 1am now, maybe day 456 will be better.

[^1]: There? Here? Hard to say which is right but I'm still here as of `today`.
