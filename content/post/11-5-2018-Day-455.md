455 days ago today I started work at a fairly large medical software company in Madison, Wisconsin. About 3 weeks in I realized I didn't want to be there[^1] very long.

Anyway its 1am now, maybe day 456 will be better.

[^1]: There? Here? Hard to say which is right but I'm still here as of `today`.
