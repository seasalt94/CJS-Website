As part of an effort to get back to engineering, I'm trying to take on small projects or hobby things that make me think through a design - from idea to build I just want to make things. This was an idea I saw a couple different places online and thought it could be a nice and easy little hardware project. I liked the idea too because there are a lot of different ways you can build off of it: add programmable RGB LEDs, make the frame geometry more complex, add sensors/ functionality to the display, etc. 


An infinity mirror is really just a display or light source (usually LEDs) sandwiched between a mirror and a two-way mirror. The light will reflect between the two interior surfaces and make the "tunnel" effect. For this project I used some 12" square acrylic mirror sheets, a strip of white LEDs, and some a cheap 2x4. This was going to be an exercise in getting familiar with the woodshop so there's nothing too complex here.

Each member of the frame has two slots cut in, one for each mirror. This actually got me in trouble because it made it so everything needed to come together at once: I put in the back mirror, lined the LEDs, but then needed to slide in the top mirror and glue the frame on without detaching the LED strip from the frame. A better design would have been something like a picture frame, where the back can come out on it's own instead of being "locked in" by the frame. Right now, if my lights go out there's no way to get in and replace them. Oh well, lessons learned.

After my last dry-fit with everything, I sanded the frame down one last time and sprayed it with a a thin coat of polycrylic. It's a fast-drying water based finish that's about as basic as you can get.

Here's the mirror with the light off:

And here is the finished product! There is a lot of dust in the woodshop so I probably should have gone to a cleaner space to put it all together, but I wanted to get it done.
